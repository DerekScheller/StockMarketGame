# StockMarketGame

I started out making a stock market game and ended up changing my direction about half way thru the project week.
I changed my project around after realizing that even with the simplest logic my AI was really hard to beat and really near impossible to win against.
At that point in time I just started to read more about market making algorithms and the possibilities of algorithm integration into different trrading platforms.
After a little research I started to beef up my screening process and integrating more statictical analysis equations to better predict market movement.
I definitly bit off more than I could chew on this one but in the end I think I have a really solid start on algorithm that will trade stock for me.
I am waiting to hear back from Robinhood (who handles my stock investments) on getting access to there beta API in an attempt to link my project and try it out with real data.
